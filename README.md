# Operation-Game
All of the code and files needed for the life-size Operation game 

Some git tutorials for those who haven't used git before:

STRUCTURE:
3 folders, each with the code for their respective projects
In general, each piece of code will house a number of related functions. As an example, there will be an instance where we will need to have a number of lights all go off. This sequence will go inside of a method that will do all of the execution, and then there will be a seperate main that will call it as needed.
Make sure that you comment your code as much as you can! That way we can know what's going on.
If you're developing a feature, the general procedure should be: branch, write the feature, commit it (to the branch), test it, fix it, test it some more, then merge back into the master branch. Make sure that you let your intentions be known when you branch! That way we don't have to write something more than once.

While some of the information files(design plans, plans, etc) may be hosted here the primary access to them will still be through the Google drive, as we can't expect everyone to use git, and it's not great for normal file storage. However, they will be added/updated occasionally, especially if they're referenced in the code. All the code will be hosted here.
I highly recommend usage of git through the command line/terminal, as it makes it much easier and simpler.

The repo is going to stay public for now, but it can be changed if the need arises.
